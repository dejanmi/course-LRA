# Object Detection Exercise {#part:lra_object_detection_title status=ready}

Excerpt: Train a neural network to recognize objects in Duckietown.

In this exercise you will train an object detection neural network. First, you will create your own training dataset with the Duckietown simulator. 
By using the segmentation maps that it outputs you will be able to label your dataset automatically. Then, you will adapt a pre-trained model to the task of detecting various classes of objects in the simulator. You will be graded on the quality of the dataset you made and the performance of your neural network model.
